## Description

The first step involves creating the structure of the web page using HTML. This will include the creation of 3 selection boxes (dropdowns) and a submit button. Next, we'll add styles to the web page using CSS. JavaScript and jQuery will then be used to make the page dynamic and interactive. The JavaScript code will handle the behavior of the selection boxes, making sure that only relevant options are shown based on the user's previous selection. AJAX will be used to fetch the data from the database and update it in real-time, without the need to refresh the page. PHP will be used to connect to the MySQL database and perform CRUD operations, such as fetching and updating the data. The data will then be displayed on the page based on the filter criteria specified by the user. The user will also be able to edit the data and submit it to the database, which will then be updated in real-time.
